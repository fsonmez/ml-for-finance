# Machine Learning and Data Analysis in Finance 

This repository contains the code I write throughout the process of learning about machine learning and statistical data analysis in the context of finance. The main references I am using in my learning are:

* [Machine Learning for Asset Managers by Marcos M. LÃ³pez de Prado](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/machine-learning-for-asset-managers/6D9211305EA2E425D33A9F38D0AE3545)
* [Learn Algorithmic Trading - Fundamentals of Algorithmic Trading by Sebastien Donadio, Sourav Ghosh](https://www.packtpub.com/data/learn-algorithmic-trading-fundamentals-of-algorithmic-trading)
    
The code is based on the examples discussed in the book with various extensions implementing techniques I read about elsewhere.
